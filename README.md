# Markus' Portfolio Website

My portfolio website has the double purpose of reaching out to prospective employers as well as likeminded people in the interwebs and the real world. So it should showcase my work experience and a few first coding projects, but also other interests that are dear to me. also, it is something that should and will grow throughout the course and beyond. projects that would be by now only represented by an image or an icon would then be linked, others added.

[Here]() is a link to the project.

## Demo

## UX

The website should be as intuitive as possible on any device with a clearly structured navigation and just as much info in each section as necessary: for instance, it should be seamlessly scrollable. The menu should always be on top, fixed. To give a quicker understanding of a few concepts, I rely on visuals and graphs.

Also, if people would like to reach me via phone there should be a button on the mobile version for that, too.
Another nice thing to add would be a map so people can see how they can get to me from where they are.

## User Stories

- As a prospective employer I want to have easy access to resume, so that I have a full picture of candidate's work bio and experience
- As a prospective employer I also want to have a quick overview of candidate, so that I have a first idea if he's a match in the first place
- As a prospective collaborator I want to understand what he's interested in and which topics he cares about in order to potentially reach out
- As user in general I want to see how I can get in touch and on what other platforms he is most active in order to connect
- As a user I want to have a clearly structured website so that I find my way around easily in order to not lose time or temper
- As a user I want a searchfield so that I can easily find content by a specific word or phrase
- As a user I want to have a nice 404 page when I enter a link to a website that doesn't exist (anymore) so I'm cheered up a bit
- As a user I want to see if I type in the formally correct text in an email form etc., already before I send the form in order to save time
  should also show if email is correct, dummy text in forms etc. and if pw is safe - also should have a 404 page
- wants a bilingual Website
